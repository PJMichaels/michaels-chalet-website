Front End:

Booking Logic:
- Load available dates:
- Load already booked dates
- Subtract booked dates from available dates
- create function for "disabled dates"
- user selected dates populate booking form
- additional form fields must be populated by user
- Request book button creates a db submission
- automatically notification to for admins via email
- re-direct to booking(s) summary page

Testing:

Expected input format for isDateDisabled func, should test the API return
and ideally confirm the not available dates cannot be booked by an end user
if they were to try.

const allowedRanges = [
   {start: new Date(2023, 9, 18), end: new Date(2023, 9, 20)},
   {start: new Date(2023, 10, 23), end: new Date(2023, 10, 25)}
];
